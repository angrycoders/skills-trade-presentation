# Skills Trade



## introduction:

**Skills Trade** is a form of barter trade, scoped to skills.

> A **skill** is the learned ability to carry out a task with

The use of skills, requires time, energy and ultimately knowledge. Money is **not** a prerequisite. The supported system, modelled around skills trade, would allow its users to exchange services on a contract basis. The "purchase" power of the users remains decentralized.



## features of supporting system:

1. open-source: owned by the community <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
1. decentralized: run by the community <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
1. free: for the community <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Note:
1. open-source
    - the future of the system is determined by the community
    - no single entity controls the development of the system
    - allows use of an open-governance model
1. decentralized
    - distributed, by design, like Bitcoin
    - can be run by volunteers, for greater good of the rest of users
1. free
    - lower entry level for new users



## solving barter trade's limitations:

1. Lack of double coincidence of wants <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
1. Division issues <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
1. Lack of a common measure of value <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
1. Lack of store of value <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note:
1. Lack of double coincidence of wants
    - being unable to find users with desirable services
    - solution: intelligent matching of compatible users
1. Division issues
    - being unable to divide services
    - solution: collaboration between users
1. Lack of a common measure of value
    - being able to save value of skills
    - solution: none yet!
1. Lack of store of value
    - being able to save
    - solution: none yet!
